Jellyfish Archipelago - Sylvie Jam entry

To do: 
- Finish all stage layouts
- Voice sound effects for collecting gems, jellyfish zap, death sound, jellyfish bounce, stage win, game win. (Can I compress them?)
- (can do after playtesting)
- Remove debug space press
- Fullscreen option for windows export, esc to quit for windows export

Completed 2/2:
- Add beachBBQ midi after quieting bass, maybe making melody a bit louder
- Credits
- Add shading to jellyfish and player sprite
- Add twinkle animation to gems (can't make it look good, don't care)

Completed 1/31:
- Boss jellyfish
- Centered all text
- Auto-advance tutorial screen after five seconds
- Figure out how to advance title screen, working around javascript music limitation (press space to start?)
- R restarts game
- Make tree and rock sand tiles solid

this is the mean cursed level arrangement. Maybe I only want to have one boss fight, end on :), and this game can actually just be nice?

2 - all still plus shooter
3 - shooter plus moving
4 - lanes
5 - harder shooter plus moving
6 - first boss encounter

8 - 4 corners
9 - TO MAKE all four kinds at once
